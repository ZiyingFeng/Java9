We use hashcode() and equals() methods in add() method of HashSet to check if the adding object is a duplicate in the HashSet. If so, then it will not add the object since a HashSet will not store duplicate value. 

Use both of the hashcode() method and equals() method is because equals() method is slwoer than hashcode() method.

hashcode() method in String class overridden the one in the Object class and used to compare the ASCII value of two String objects.

equals() method in String class overridden the one in the Object class, which can compare the char of two strings one by one for checking the equality.
